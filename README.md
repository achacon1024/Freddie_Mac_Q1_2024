Overview:

This project was created as part of my application for the Data Analyst role at New American Funding. The objective was to demonstrate my skills in data processing, analysis, and visualization using real-world mortgage data. Hereâ€™s a summary of the workflow:

1. Data Acquisition: Downloaded a raw data set from Freddie Mac for Q1, 2024. The dataset is available for reference and download via the Dropbox link provided here.
2. Data Storage: Uploaded the raw data into Snowflake for secure storage and efficient querying.
3. Data Cleaning: Performed data cleaning within Snowflake using SQL to ensure accuracy and consistency across key metrics. 
4. Data Export and Import: Exported the cleaned data to a CSV file, which is also available for download via Dropbox, then imported it into Power BI for further transformation and visualization.
5. Data Transformation: Applied additional transformations in Power Query within Power BI to enhance data usability and accuracy in visualizations.
6. Data Modeling: Modeled the data using a star schema structure, with a central fact table and supporting dimension tables. This schema was designed to optimize performance and support intuitive reporting. Image of the star schema is included in the Dropbox link.
7. DAX Functions: Created a variety of DAX functions to enable dynamic calculations and deeper analysis across different segments of the data. Various screenshots are included in the Dropbox link.
8. Visualization and Reporting: Developed three pages of visualizations in Power BI to provide insights into the portfolio's performance, servicer metrics, and borrower characteristics. These visualizations, as well as the Power BI project file, are available in the Dropbox link.
